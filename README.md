# nanoAI-zoo

Concise, modular implementations of foundational AI models for research and experimentation across CV, LLM, VLM, and Generative AI.

## Overview

nanoAI-zoo is a comprehensive collection of lightweight and modular implementations of foundational AI models. Designed for researchers and practitioners, it provides easy access to state-of-the-art architectures across various domains including Computer Vision (CV), Large Language Models (LLM), Vision-Language Models (VLM), and Generative AI.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:
- `CV/`: Implementations of foundational computer vision models.
- `LLM/`: Implementations of large language models.
- `VLM/`: Implementations of vision-language models.
- `GenAI/`: Implementations of generative AI models.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and tools to support model implementations.
- `assets/`: Pre-trained model weights and datasets.
- `docs/`: Documentation and tutorials.
